PURPOSE:
  The purpose of our app will be to help those who struggle with the universal issue of “What should I eat?!” Usage is simple: Having the user input 3 or more ingredients, along with what kind of meal they are looking for and any allergies, will prompt a short list of recipes (or will give recipes one by one, with the option for the user to say “Let’s try another recipe.”) 

RESPONSIBLE AI USE:	
To set it up, clone the repository, install the required dependencies, and run the app. We are committed to responsible AI use: recipes are suggestions only, users should check for allergies and food safety, and ingredient inputs are not stored or shared.
 
SPRINT 0 FEATURE SPEC:
	As a user, what I want most is for the program to show me a few options for making a meal with the ingredients that I have on hand.  It doesn’t make the decision for me, unless I ask it to, and gives me the ability to decide what I can make.  Inputs depend on what the user has available, in return, they are given recipes for meal options.  The risk we run is that there are not enough ingredients, limiting the recipe options, which is why we run the minimum number of 3 ingredients.  Constraints will be the number of options that the user is provided with as Choice Overload, leading the back to square 1 of “What do I eat?”
